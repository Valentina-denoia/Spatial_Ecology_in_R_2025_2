# How to import external data in R

#To import data into R, the working directory must be set. To do that, we need to know the path of the working directory in "get info" of the proprietes

#The packages needed in this script are the following

''' r
library(terra) # managing raster and vector data 
library (imageR) #

#the # next to the function will appear in Markdown

#we need to put the tilde symbol (~) and the slash /
setwd("~/Dowlads/")

#Once I gave him the working directory, to check it I need to put:
getwd()

group <- rast ("image.JPG")
# If you receive errors, check that the path is correct and the image is inside the folder you selected

#to get info on the image, digit its name by:

group

#the double ## is used for the subtitles in the preview part

# to plot the image, we will use the RB scheme: 
#layer 1 = Red, layer 2 = greeen wavelenght, layer 3  blue wavelenght 

im.plotRGB(group, r=1, g=2, b=3) 

#at this point, the image will be flipped down, so to flip it up, I can solve the problem by using the flip() function

group <- flip (group)

The output plot can be exported by the png () function 
''r
png(2group_foto")
im.plotRGB(group, r=1, g=2, b=3) 
dev.off ()

#to import the picture in Markdown, I can just bring it with the mouse

# now Let's invert the bands to create a false color image (without the natural color). This can be used to find an object or something that is not visible with natural colors:
png("groupo_photo_false")



Another way to create Markdown is to put my code "you should develop a Markdown based on the following R code, which is needed for the exam.

```r
png("group_photo_false.png")
im.plotRGB(group, r=2, g=1, b=3)
dev.off()
```
